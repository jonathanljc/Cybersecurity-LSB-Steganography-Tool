# üõ°Ô∏è GUI-Based LSB Steganography and Steganalysis Program
## üìÑ Project Overview

The **GUI-based LSB Steganography and Steganalysis Program** was developed as part of **INF2005 - Cybersecurity Fundamentals ACW1**. It enables users to encode and decode text payloads into various cover objects, such as images, audio, and video files. Key features include:

- **Support for multiple cover object types**: BMP, PNG, WAV, MP4.
- **Selectable number of LSBs (1 to 8)** for encoding and decoding.
- **Drag-and-drop functionality** for selecting cover objects, payloads, and stego objects.
- **Real-time playback and display** of cover and stego objects for comparison.
- **Error handling** for payload size limits relative to the cover object.

```bash
python lsb_steganography.py
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing Steps
Encode Hidden Text:

- Upload a cover image (e.g., duck.jpg).
- Upload a payload file containing the hidden text you wish to encode.
- Specify the number of LSBs (Least Significant Bits) to encode.
- The application will generate a stego image.

Decode Hidden Text:

- Upload the stego image.
- Set the same number of LSBs used during encoding.
- The application will output the decoded hidden text.
